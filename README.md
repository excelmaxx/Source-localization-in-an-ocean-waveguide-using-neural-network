# Read me - Source localization in an ocesan waveguide using FNN (tensorflow)

This project explores the use of current machine learning
methods for source range localization. The feed-forward
neural network (FNN), support vector machine (SVM)
and random forest (RF) methods are investigated.

The code are in the .\code directory.
#### To Run the code
before put the SCMs input data in the directory ./code/data, and name the folder for different snapshots and frequencies as "DataSet01_550Hz_snap=5" or you can modified the directory in the code to where you like.  

Thank you!
