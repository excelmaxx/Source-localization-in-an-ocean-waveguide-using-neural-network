### Read me - Source localization in an ocesan waveguide using FNN (tensorflow)

The code are in the .\code directory.
Run the code, before put the SCMs input data in the directory ./code/data, and name the folder for different snapshots and frequencies as "DataSet01_550Hz_snap=5" or you can modified the directory in the code to where you like.  

Thank you!
